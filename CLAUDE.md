# Giga Khizanishvili — Personal GitHub Pages Site

## Overview
Personal portfolio/resume website for Giga Khizanishvili, hosted via GitHub Pages.
Static HTML/CSS/JS — no build tools or frameworks required.

## Git Identity
- **Always use this identity for commits in this repo:**
  - Name: `Giga Khizanishvili`
  - Email: `khizanag@gmail.com`
- This is configured via local git config (`user.name` and `user.email`)
- **Never** use the work email (`giga.khizanishvili@space.ge`) for this repository

## Workflow Rules
- **Always commit directly to `master`** — no feature branches
- **Always push to remote after every commit**
- Keep the site as a single `index.html` unless complexity requires splitting

## Structure
- `index.html` — the entire site (HTML + inline CSS + JS)

## Deployment
- GitHub Pages serves from the `master` branch root
- Any push to `master` triggers automatic deployment
