    "question": "How do you contribute to creating an inclusive team environment? Give a specific example.",
    "hint": "Think beyond policy compliance. How do you actively ensure all voices are heard, different perspectives are valued, and everyone feels they belong?",
    "answer": "A strong answer includes:\n- Specific actions beyond 'I treat everyone the same'\n- Actively ensuring quieter team members have space to contribute in meetings\n- Being aware of and challenging their own biases in hiring, code reviews, and collaboration\n- Advocating for inclusive practices: inclusive language in code, accessible documentation, diverse hiring\n- Creating psychological safety: making it okay to ask questions, make mistakes, and disagree\n- Educating themselves about different perspectives and experiences\n- Speaking up when witnessing exclusionary behavior, even when it's uncomfortable\n- Measurable impact on team culture or composition"

    "question": "What qualities do you look for in a company or team? How do you evaluate culture fit during your job search?",
    "hint": "Be genuine about what matters to you. Show that you think critically about culture rather than just accepting whatever is offered.",
    "answer": "A strong answer includes:\n- Specific, thoughtful values rather than generic answers ('good culture', 'smart people')\n- Concrete evaluation methods: asking specific questions in interviews, talking to current employees, researching on Glassdoor\n- Examples of deal-breakers and must-haves based on past experience\n- Understanding that culture fit is bidirectional — they are evaluating the company too\n- Distinction between comfort zone and genuine values alignment\n- Awareness that advertised culture and actual culture can differ\n- Questions they ask to evaluate culture: how are decisions made, how is failure handled, what does growth look like\n- Red flags: no preferences at all, or only caring about perks and compensation"

    "question": "How do you approach technical debt as a team issue rather than just a technical one? Describe a time you advocated for addressing tech debt.",
    "hint": "Focus on how you quantified the cost of tech debt, built consensus for addressing it, and balanced it against feature delivery.",
    "answer": "A strong answer includes:\n- Framing tech debt in business terms: developer velocity, bug rate, onboarding time, incident frequency\n- Tracking and quantifying tech debt rather than just complaining about it\n- Building a compelling case for stakeholders: cost of inaction vs. cost of remediation\n- Proposing pragmatic approaches: allocating a percentage of sprints, boy-scout rule, dedicated tech debt sprints\n- Getting buy-in from product managers and leadership, not just engineering\n- Prioritizing tech debt by impact rather than trying to fix everything at once\n- Preventing new tech debt through better practices: code review, architecture review, definition of done\n- Celebrating and communicating wins when tech debt is resolved"
